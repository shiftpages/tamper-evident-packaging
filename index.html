          <!--  <h1>What it is</h1> -->
            <p>A packaging that significantly raises the cost of tampering during shipping or storage. The security mechanism of BitBoxTep is a temporary locked particle fingerprint which is verified via image comparison of a reference image taken prior to shipment. It is currently in alpha stage and we are in the process of iterating the design towards a beta.</p>
            <p>Our solution aims to serve targeted industries beyond sensitive crypto devices: such as privacy and security focused smartphone manufacturers, pharma- and biotech companies, labs handling toxic or radioactive probes, narcotics or doping testlabs, dice and card manufacturers, jewels and gemstone dealers, antiques and art agencies, etc. Anywhere small scale physical goods have to be protected from being looked at, manipulated, replaced or disappearing undetected, BitBoxTep is the potential solution.</p>

            <h1>How it works</h1>
            <p>BitBoxTep proposes a temporary locked fingerprint consisting of spherical particles. The particles are contained in a pouch that when placed under vacuum locks the particles in place to create the temporary fingerprint. When the vacuum bag is opened, the particles mix. This makes it extremely difficult to replicate the original fingerprint.</p>

            <h1>Alpha program</h1>
            <p>From December 2019 to January 2020 we selected a limited number of alpha testers to give us feedback on BitBoxTep. We invited them to perform various attempts to bypass the security mechanism of our first prototypes.</p>
            <p>We have received valuable inputs on how to possibly iterate the design, what potential attacks to consider and where our community sees market potential. Despite offering a bounty for successful attacks, none of the alpha testers have managed to break in and reseal BitBoxTep with the fingerprint intact.</p>
            <p>Our alpha testers especially liked the simple and understandable security mechanism and the clear instructions on how to verify the temporary locked fingerprint prior to opening. The majority appreciated the idea of reusability if it can be worked out to function reliably.</p>
            <p>In addition, the alpha testers gave suggestions for improvement. The majority consider the QR code on the alpha particle pouches an unnecessary phishing danger. Also multiple participants would prefer to receive instructions and the reference image via email in the form of a shipping confirmation instead of verifying the fingerprint in an online database until there is an app available.</p>
            <p>With regards to hardware, we have learned to look into different color concepts. For example, potentially using a bright color plastic box to make it more difficult to manipulate without the receiver noticing. <br />A first test with liquid nitrogen (-196°C) has revealed that while the particles could not be frozen to the pouch easily, the adhesive of the velcro looses cohesive strength at these temperatures.</p>

            <h1>Development</h1>
            <p>We’ve prototyped a number of particle pouch designs with different materials, sizes and colors. Our main focus is to identify the best suitable material combination for the particle pouch (rigid, soft) which would lock the particles in place while ensuring that they become loose and mix when the vacuum pressure is released.</p>
            <p>Currently we are able to lock over 95% of the particles. A handful of particles in tight clusters tend to move within a small area, which we consider acceptable.</p>
            <p>We use industrial grade vacuum sealing equipment to make reproducible test sets. Our alpha prototypes have been tested to work in a temperature range between +40°C and -20°C. We have started with very low temperature tests using liquid nitrogen (-196°C) and also work to increase the upper temperature limitations. Lastly, we continually work on improving the duration of the vacuum seal so the particles can remain locked in position and still become loose again when the package is opened.</p>
